Year 2142, Sector XV.

The war between the Galactic Republic and the rebels rages on. A Rebel scouting force has entered our home sector. 
This attack was unexpected; the Republic fleet is on the way, but their arrival time is unknown.

Your mission is to find and destroy the Rebel flagship, or survive until the Republic fleet arrives.

Be wary of the meteors. Sector XV meteors are tough. Avoid them at all costs. 

Civilian ships and Republic outposts may occasionally send you aid. Pick them up.

The first enemy ships are ahead...
